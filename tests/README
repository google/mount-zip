ABOUT

Test suite for comparing performance of virtual filesystems.

You need Tcl 8.4 or later to run it.

The following virtual file systems can be tested:

fuse-zip    >=0.2.0         FUSE filesystem to mount, extract and modify ZIP
                            archives (http://fuse-zip.googlecode.com)
kio-zip     part of KDE3    KDE virtual filesystem zip://
kio-krarc   part of KDE3    KDE virtual filesystem krarc://
mc-uzip     part of mc      Midnight Commander VFS module
gfvs-fuse   >=0.2.4         Gnome userspace virtual filesystem - fuse bridge
unpackfs    >=0.0.6         Filesystem based on fuse (filesystem in userspace)
                            for transparent unpacking of archives
                            (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/unpackfs/)
avfs-fuse   >=0.9.8         AVFS is a system, which enables all programs to
                            look inside archived or compressed files, or
                            access remote files without recompiling the
                            programs or changing the kernel
                            (http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf/)
fusej-zip   2.4-prerelease1 FUSE-J provides Java binding for FUSE. It comes
                            with the "proof-of-concept" ZIP filesystem which
                            seems to be pretty stable.

USAGE

Edit paths in the head of run-tests.tcl before running it.

# ./run-tests.tcl

Test reaults will be saved into 'logs' subdirectory.
Make sure that none of testing participants are not running on starting tests.
Please, run at least one KDE application in background.
