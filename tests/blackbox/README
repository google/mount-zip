Test suite for black box testing of fuse-zip.

You need the following programs and libraries:
Tcl >= 8.5
tcllib >= 1.10
BLT
Tclx
attr
diff
socat
sudo (optional)
valgrind
zip

To run testsuite invoke command
$ ./fuse-zip.test
or
$ ./fuse-zip.test -valgrind
to check memory errors with valgrind.

Some tests require root access. To run them use -sudo flag and configure
sudoers in NOPASSWD mode (don't do this unless you are really know all security
impacts!):
user ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/mknod /tmp/fuse-zip-tests-[0-9]*/mountPoint-special-device-create/block b 8 255
user ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/mknod /tmp/fuse-zip-tests-[0-9]*/mountPoint-special-device-create/char c 4 63

Additional options can be passed to valgrind using VALGRIND_ARGS environment
variable. For example, you can ask valgrind to generate suppressions (that can
be added to file valgrind.supp) by specifying the following variable value:
VALGRIND_ARGS="--gen-suppressions=all"

To get list of all tests use -list switch.

To run only interected tests instead of full test suite, pass test identifier
patterns (glob-like) to testsuite script.
For example:
$ ./fuse-zip.test 'truncate-*' 'rename-*'
